How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
In order to interpret user needs and implement them into a program it is important to understand what outcome the user wants from a specific functionality of your program. User stories help to accomplish this by outlining, first and foremost, the importance of that specific customer request, so that they can be added to the backlog accordingly. They also help to outline what should be seen on the user end when the functionality is added. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
One of the main approaches to developing programs is to have a loose plan for how to continuously submit working code for the customer and the user. If you are just pulling random tasks from the backlog that can't be compiled to working code at the end of a sprint, then the customer doesn't have very tangible evidence that things are being completed. In the future, I hope to icorporate sprints, standup meetings, product backlog, and user stories into my future development work.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member can really be summed up into one word: communication. If you are a good communicator then your team is all the more stronger for it. Communication can let the members of your team know if your require assistance with a task, or vice versa. Communication can also help to make sure that nobody on the team is doing arbitrary work. It can also help with coaching and learning new things. By actively communicating, you are showing your team that you are invested in the end product, and wanting to accomplish the teams goals as quickly and efficiently as possible.
